Yeah!

Installation
============

Easy Peasy... clone this repo and ``cd`` to it. Then you'll need
``python`` and ``node``. You have them, right?

.. code:: bash

  $> npm install
  $> pip install requirements.py

There you go.

Now have fun creating agents \\o/!

Documentation
=============

We don't have docs yet, we're still pretty much in alpha mode.

We have two very basic sample agents though, feel free to take a look
at ``game/agents/`` and you'll see examples.

Contributions
=============

Like we said, we're still very alpha, but we would love all the help
we can get. Pull request any changes you want to see in the game and
we'll discuss.
